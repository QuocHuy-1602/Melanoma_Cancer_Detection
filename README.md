Choosing

Skin cancer that is lethal, called melanoma, requires an early and precise diagnosis. This dataset enables academics and practitioners to create strong machine-learning models that can differentiate between benign and malignant tumors by utilizing cutting-edge technologies. The 224 by 224 pixel photos are all of the same size and provide a thorough overview of the various forms that melanoma can take.

Sources of Motivation

This collection is motivated by the urgent demand for sophisticated dermatological diagnostic instruments. These photos, which were assembled from several sources, highlight the complex characteristics that make conventional diagnostic techniques difficult to use. We welcome the international data science community to work together, be creative, and contribute to the creation of trustworthy models for melanoma classification by making this dataset available on Kaggle.
